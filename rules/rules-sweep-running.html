                <p class="story_item__desc">
                  The Promotion will consist of one Sweepstake. By participating in the “Cardiac Peak Running” (“Sweepstake”), you agree to be bound by these Promotion Official Rules. The Promotion will begin on April 22, 2021 and end on December 31, 2021 (“Promotion Period”), with the final date to enter the promotion November 5, 2021 (“Final Entry Date”). Multiple registrations and entries are permitted as outlined below. Please read these Promotion Official Rules before entering the Promotion. Failure to comply with these Promotion Official Rules may (in the sole discretion of Cardiac Peak) result in disqualification from the Promotion. You must meet the eligibility requirements and follow the Promotion Official Rules regarding participation as set forth here. Cardiac Peak reserves the right to cancel, modify or suspend the Promotion at any time in its sole discretion. The Sweepstake is focused on the Exercise (“Exercise”) of “Running”. 

                </p>
                <p class="story_item__desc">
                  The Promotion will consist of multiple Exercise running challenges (each, a “Challenge”) to accommodate participant’s various exercise preferences and fitness levels, including Challenges for beginners, intermediate and advanced fitness levels. Challenges can be added, altered or inactivated throughout the Promotion Period. Adding, altering or inactivating any Challenge does not affect any terms within these rules, including registration, eligibility, entry, prize or odds of winning. Altering or inactivating a challenge may be to improve the overall exercise and fitness experience and does not affect any previous Entries; all eligible Entry(ies) will remain valid. New Challenges may be introduced to provide more options of exercise, fitness and Entry for each participant. 

                </p>
                <!-- <p class="story_item__desc">
                  The Promotion is comprised of multiple sweepstakes (each, a "Sweepstake"): the Couch to Cardiac Fit Sweepstake (“Cardiac Fit”), the Weight Loss Challenge Sweepstake (“Weight Loss”) and the 10,000 Steps Sweepstake (“10,000 Steps”). Each Sweepstake is governed by the rules herein. Each Sweepstake is focused on one Exercise (“Exercise”), as follows:

                  2. Promotion Registration
                </h4>
                <p class="story_item__desc">
                  To participate in the Promotion, you must first become a registered user of Cardiac Peak (“App”) and provide a valid email address. Cardiac Peak is free to use and there is no purchase necessary. Registration must be completed by the Final Entry Date. The participant (“Participant”) must then select in the App a Running Challenge by searching and then clicking on a Running Challenge in the App, then clicking “Sign up” in the Challenge. 
                </p>
                <p class="story_item__desc">
                  You may participate in each active Challenge during the Promotion Period on or before the Final Entry Date. Multiple Challenges are allowed and you can participate in each Challenge multiple times; however you may not participate in more than one “Running” Challenge, of this Promotion or another Cardiac Peak promotion, at the same time. 
                </p>
                <p class="story_item__desc">
                  Upon “Sign up” for a Running Challenge, the App will create an Exercise Schedule within the App consisting of multiple exercises (each, an Exercise), including an Exercise detail page and schedule date of each Exercise. The Exercise Schedule will be eight (8) weeks in length and considered the entry period (“Entry Period”), with the Beginning Date on the day of registration or the day following registration and the Ending Date eight (8) weeks following the Beginning Date. 

                </p>
                <p class="story_item__desc">
                  Entry Period can not conflict with another Entry Period, of this Promotion or a Sweepstake or Contest of another Cardiac Peak promotion, where the Sweepstake or Contest Exercise is the same. For example, Couch to Cardiac Fit and Cardio Fitness & Weight Loss are both Challenges focused on Running. You may participate in Couch to Cardiac Fit, then only after the Entry Period of Couch to Cardiac Fit has ended and if on or before the Final Entry Date, you may register to participate in Cardio Fitness & Weight Loss (or another Running Challenge of this or another Cardiac Peak Promotion); however, you may participate in Couch to Cardiac Fit and 10,000 Steps concurrently, since 10,000 Steps is a Sweepstake from another Cardiac Peak promotion that is focused on Steps, not Running.
